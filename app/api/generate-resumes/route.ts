REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create EXACTLY 2 people only (person1 and person2)
2. Use REAL well-known and prestigious company/university names (Google, Harvard, Goldman Sachs, etc.) - NO fictional names
3. NEVER use dates after ${currentDate} - all dates must be realistic
4. MAXIMUM 5 career positions per person - focus on key milestone roles
5. Order ALL items chronologically (earliest to latest dates)

CAREER PROGRESSION STRATEGY:
- FIRST HALF: Use DIFFERENT but similar companies/roles in same industry as user.
- SECOND HALF: Show DRAMATICALLY FASTER career progression within the SAME career field - rapid promotions, earlier leadership roles, accelerated timeline to success
- STAY WITHIN USER'S CAREER PATH: E.g. If user is in HR, show HR leadership roles; if in finance, show finance executive roles; if in tech, show tech leadership
- End with: C-suite roles, successful startups, major leadership positions IN THE SAME FIELD achieved YEARS ahead of typical timeline
- NEVER change career fields - accelerate success within their existing trajectory

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Education: Slightly enhanced (higher GPA, honors, similar degree/timing as user)
- Use specific achievements: funding raised, team sizes, revenue impact, major deals
- NEVER use placeholder text - generate realistic, impressive details
- Generate specific metrics and outcomes that clearly exceed user's achievements
- NEVER use dates after ${currentDate} - all dates must be realistic
